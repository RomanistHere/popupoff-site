		<p>By using the app, I (user) understand and agree to to the next conditions:</p>

		<ul class="list-disc pl-4 my-8 space-y-2">
			<li>
				PopUpOFF uses certain algorithms to detect and destroy overlays, but internet is
				different and it means that the extension can work poorly on some websites.
			</li>
			<li>
				Behind all the work there is a single person and known issues can persist for
				continuous time without being resolved for this app is free and is being worked on
				in its developer's spare time.
